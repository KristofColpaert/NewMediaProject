#New Media Project

This project is a school assignment. It consists of a Processing application where users can draw objects using their hands and a Leap Motion sensor. Afterwards, these drawings are converted to commands that can be executed by a Parrot AR Drone. As this drone was equipped with some led lights, it was possible to capture its movements into a light painting (which resembled the drawings of the user).
